# Different ways to add css to the Page 
- Inline Stying 
    - within the tag we are going to add a attribute called `style `. In which we can write our css code 

- External Styling 
    - 

- Internal CSS 
    - we need to use the `style tag` in the Head Tag 
    - ``` h1 { color: #4e4e4e ;}```
    - 

-  External CSS 
    - One File to control all the pages


- Selector 
    - Element Selector 
    - class selector 
        - we use `.`
        - class for groups 
        - we can use class for over and over again 
        - Spaces causes Problems , if we want to have 2 different name use - / _ to join both words 
        - ```   
            ```
        - 
    - id selector 
        - we use the `#` selector
        - id is for individual 
        - ID can be used only once within the page 
        - ID Will override the class if they are both selecting the same thing
